          Synchronous: each task gets executed one after another and must wait for its previous task to be completed before it can be executed
          pros:
          - easier to understand
          - supported by all programming languages
          - easier to manage and debug
          cons:
          - blocking: tasks must complete before the next task can be executed
          - slower and more methodical
          - if a task fails, the subsequent tasks will not be executed
          - more resources might be needed to execute the tasks

          Asynchronous: tasks start executing without waiting for a different task to finish 
          pros:
          - non-blocking: each task can be handled in parallel
          - failure of one task does not affect the execution of the other tasks
          - less resources are required to execute the tasks
          cons:
          - might be difficult to implement in some programming languages
          - code can get messy and difficult to debug
        </p><h4>Which one do you prefer and why?</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        Depends on the problem and the programming language
        There is no one best answer, its all about understanding the tradeoffs and what problems we are trying to solve
      </p><h4>When would you use one over the other?</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        When a task requires long computation time, or when the task is required to be non-blocking for better user experience in the UI, Asynchronous will be a better approach
        For simple apps, Synchronous might be better
      </p></div><div style="border-bottom:1px solid red"><h2>SQL and NoSQL</h2><h4>What are they?</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        SQL stands for Structured Query Language, it is typically used for relational databases

        NoSQL stands for Non-Structured Query Language, it is typically used for non-relational databases
      </p><h4>What are their key differences, and pros and cons?</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        Key differences:
        SQL:
          - Storage: stores data in tables where each row represents an entity, each column represents a data point about that entity
          - Schema: defined schema, columns must be decided and chosen before data entry
          - Querying: use SQL
          - Scalability: vertically scalable, horizontally scalable is also possible but is challenging and time-consuming
          - Reliability: ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

        NoSQL:
          - Storage: have different data storage models (e.g.: key-value, document, graph, wide-column)
          - Schema: can be schemaless or dynamic
          - Querying: different databases have different syntax
          - Scalability: horizontally scalable, a lot of NoSQL tech also distribute data across servers automatically
          - Reliability: BASE compliant (Basically available, Soft State, Eventual Consistency)
        </p><h4>Which one do you prefer and why?</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">All about tradeoffs, depends on the problem and budget</p><h4>When would you use one over the other?</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        use SQL database if ACID compliance is needed, or when data is structured and unchanging, or when both Consistency and Availability are needed
        use NoSQL if there is partition, or when rapid development is required, or when data has little to no structure
      </p></div><div style="border-bottom:1px solid red"><h2>Statically-typed and dynamically-typed programming languages</h2><h4>What do they mean?</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        Dynamically-typed Language: resolution of types, members, properties, methods are done at run-time
        Statically-typed Language: resolution of types, members, properties, methods are done at compile-time
      </p><h4>Describe their pros and cons.</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        Dynamically-typed Language:
        - pros: easier to understand, pickup, and write code
        - cons: lose compile-time checking, have to write more unit tests to ensure app behaves properly at run-time
        Statically-typed Language:
        - pros: easier to debug as error messages are provided at compile-time
        - cons: harder to understand, harder to pickup, harder to write code
      </p><h4>Which do you generally prefer, and why would you use one over the other?</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        Depends on the use case
        But generally I would prefer Statically-typed due to the compile-time checking, which makes it easier to debug
        It is also easier to maintain over the long run

Describe situations you can think of where database transactions are necessary, and where they are not.</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        It is required for data integrity

        During an important transaction for example a money transfer from User A to User B, it is either the transaction is completed successfully or it is not
        If the transaction is not completed, the data is not updated in the database
        It would not be good to see the money that was transferred to be lost somewhere due to any failures at any point in the process

        Contents such as a user&#x27;s profile, or a user&#x27;s cart are not critical and can be updated without a transaction
        </p><h4>How would you scale access to database, and ensure its resilience and data integrity/consistency at the same time?</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        It would depend on how critical it is to guarantee consistency of replicated data at write time
        Usually ACID model would be the right approach, just that it would be harder to implement the scaling part

        BASE model would be good for easy scalability, however even if we choose a NoSQL with high consistency, it does not guarantees the write time like ACID does

        If cost is not a concern, using Google Spanner might be a good choice to cover all the requirements
        </p><h4>How would you do database backups effectively, without resorting to full database dumps all the time?</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        Create a cronjob that periodically backups the database based on the last modified date and time

        - provide a lightweight, fast, isolated infrastructure to run the app
        - easy to deploy, scale, and maintain
        - smaller in size compared to a virtual machine

        Cons:
        - shares the kernel of the OS, if the kernel becomes vulnerable, all containers will be affected

        - REST has multiple endpoints, whereas GraphQL has a single endpoint
        - REST is URL-Driven, whereas GraphQL is query-driven
        - REST uses HTTP verbs to perform a request, whereas GraphQL uses a query language to perform a request with only a POST request

        REST:
        pros:
        - easier to implement
        - no special libraries are required to use when writing on the client side
        cons:
        - updating of backend or frontend to filter data is tedious each time there is a requirement change
        - multiple http calls might be required to get the data if app is complex

        GraphQL:
        pros:
        - easy to filter and sort data via GraphQL Schema Definition Language
        - less http calls are required to get data
        - responsive and with low latency
        cons:
        - higher learning curve
        - special libraries are required to use when writing on the client side
        - can be overkill for simple apps
        - vulnerable to DDoS attacks if server does not have the right protections
        - monitoring and error reporting is difficult
        - no default http caching
        </p><h4>When would you use one over the other?</h4><p style="white-space:pre-line">        use REST when data fetching is simple, or when the app requires a robust API, with caching and a monitoring system

        use GraphQL when data fetching is nested and complex and for mobile apps
