    It is a Higher order function because it returns the function as output
    It is also a closure because it gives access to an outer function's scope from an inner function
    - The maker is synchronous and returns an Asynchronous function
    - It takes in an argument x which is used to update the string value inside the anonymous function that is being returned
    - It allows modification of the inner function contents from the outer function
    - It allows access to the inner function before being executed, which also allows us to modify the contents of the inner function

        ans: `\
        Key differences:
          Synchronous: each task gets executed one after another and must wait for its previous task to be completed before it can be executed
          pros:
          - easier to understand
          - supported by all programming languages
          - easier to manage and debug
          cons:
          - blocking: tasks must complete before the next task can be executed
          - slower and more methodical
          - if a task fails, the subsequent tasks will not be executed
          - more resources might be needed to execute the tasks

          Asynchronous: tasks start executing without waiting for a different task to finish 
          pros:
          - non-blocking: each task can be handled in parallel
          - failure of one task does not affect the execution of the other tasks
          - less resources are required to execute the tasks
          cons:

          - Reliability: ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

        NoSQL:
          - Storage: have different data storage models (e.g.: key-value, document, graph, wide-column)
          - Schema: can be schemaless or dynamic
          - Querying: different databases have different syntax

        ans: `\
        It is required for data integrity

        During an important transaction for example a money transfer from User A to User B, it is either the transaction is completed successfully or it is not
        If the transaction is not completed, the data is not updated in the database
        It would not be good to see the money that was transferred to be lost somewhere due to any failures at any point in the process

        It would depend on how critical it is to guarantee consistency of replicated data at write time
        Usually ACID model would be the right approach, just that it would be harder to implement the scaling part

        BASE model would be good for easy scalability, however even if we choose a NoSQL with high consistency, it does not guarantees the write time like ACID does

    - best if boss set reasonable goals by first discussing with the team on the deadlines and requirements before commiting
    - ideal if no mandatory work hours is required as long as work is done properly with quality on time
