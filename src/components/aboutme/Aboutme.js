        How it all began.
      </h3>
      <p style={{textAlign: "justify", color: "#CFCFCF", margin: "10px 100px"}}>
        Software engineering has always been an interest of mine. I wrote my first line of code in C++ during polytechnic (High School equivalent) and had graduated with a Diploma in Electronics, Computer, and Communications Engineering.
      </p>
      <p style={{textAlign: "justify", color: "#CFCFCF", margin: "10px 100px"}}>
        After that, I wanted to acquire a broad and varied knowledge of the arts and sciences, which led me to pursue an International Liberal Arts Degree.
      </p>
      <p style={{textAlign: "justify", color: "#CFCFCF", margin: "10px 100px"}}>
        During my job experience, I had witnessed the usefulness of programming, especially in the area of workflow automation. Wanting to know more, I delve into expanding my understanding of software engineering, which led me to discover new technologies such as mobile, data science, web, VR / AR, and many more.
      </p>
      <p style={{textAlign: "justify", color: "#CFCFCF", margin: "10px 100px"}}>
        In all the experiences I went through have cemented my interest in craving the ability to create applications of my own.
